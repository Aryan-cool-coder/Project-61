      <p>   Sans is a character in the game Undertale and is a skeleton who is lazy. Once you fight him after killing his brother however, he becomes the hardest boss in the game. He also has many mysteries shrouded around him, such as how he got this power, or who he is, or why he and his brother are the only skeletons in the whole entire game. The internet is still trying to solve these mysteries, and its amazing how he can seem so lazy, and laid back, when he is actually way deeper than meets the eye. His deppression for all his friends dying to a human takes him over and he doesnt joke around with you anymore. He is one of the only characters aware about him being in a game, his whole world being controlled by a human, him being lines of code. Yet, he keeps on figthing you to save his world and keep you fighting him forever, until you give up. </p></section><section class="reviews" id="reviews">
